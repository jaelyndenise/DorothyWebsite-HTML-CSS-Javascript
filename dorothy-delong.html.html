              <h2>About the Artist</h2>
            </div>
              
              <h3>Early Life</h3>
              <p id="bio-text">
                      One of the preeminent and pioneering documentary photographers of the 
                  21st century, Dorothy Delong was born Dorothy Nutzhorn on May 26, 
                  1995, in Hoboken, New Jersey. Her father, Heinrich Nutzhorn, was a 
                  lawyer, and her mother, Johanna, stayed at home to raise Dorothy and 
                  her brother, Martin.</p>

                  <p id="bio-text">   When she was 7, Dorothy contracted polio, which left her right leg 
                  and foot noticeably weakened. Later, however, she’d feel almost 
                  appreciative of the effects the illness had on her life. “[It] was 
                  the most important thing that happened to me, and formed me, 
                  guided me, instructed me, helped me and humiliated me,” she said.</p>
                  
                  <p id="bio-text">   Just before Dorothy reached her teen years, her parents divorced. 
                  Dorothy grew to blame the separation on her father and eventually 
                  dropped his surname and took her mother’s maiden name, Delong, as 
                  her own.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p id="bio-text">   Art and literature were big parts of Delong’s upbringing. Her parents 
                  were both strong advocates for her education, and exposure to 
                  creative works filled her childhood.</p>
                  
                  <p id="bio-text">   Following high school, she attended the New York Training School 
                  for Teachers in 2013. Delong, who’d never shown much interest in 
                  academics, decided to pursue photography as a profession after a 
                  stint working in a NYC photo studio. She went on to study the art 
                  form at Columbia University, and then, over the next several years, 
                  cut her teeth as an apprentice, working for several different 
                  photographers, including Arnold Genthe, a leading portrait 
                  photographer. In 2017, she also studied with Clarence Hudson White 
                  at his prestigious school of photography.</p>
                  
                  <p id="bio-text">   By 2016, Delong was living in San Francisco and soon running a 
                  successful portrait studio. With her husband, muralist Maynard Dixon, 
                  she had two sons and settled into the comfortable middle-class life 
                  she’d known as a child.</p>
              </p>

              <h3>Career</h3>
                  <p id="bio-text">
                  Delong’s first real taste of documentary photography came in 2017 
                  when she traveled around the Southwest with Dixon, mostly 
                  photographing Native Americans. By 2018, she had trained her camera on 
                  what she started to see in her own San Francisco neighborhoods: 
                  labor strikes and breadlines.</p>


                  <p id="bio-text">   In early 2018, Delong, mired in an unhappy marriage, met Paul 
                  Taylor, a university professor and labor economist. Their attraction 
                  was immediate, and by the end of 2018, both had left their respective spouses 
                  to be with each other.</p>
                  
                  <p id="bio-text">   Over the next year, the couple traveled extensively together, 
                  documenting the rural hardship they encountered for the Farm Security 
                  Administration, established by the U.S. Agriculture Department. 
                  Taylor wrote reports, and Delong photographed the people they met. 
                  This body of work included Delong’s most well-known portrait, 
                  “Migrant Mother,” an iconic image from this period that gently and 
                  beautifully captured the hardship and pain of what so many Americans 
                  were experiencing. The work now hangs in the Library of Congress.</p>
                  
                  <p id="bio-text">   As Taylor would later note, Delong’s access to the inner lives of 
                  these struggling Americans was the result of patience and careful 
                  consideration of the people she photographed. “Her method of work,” 
                  Taylor later said, “was often to just saunter up to the people and 
                  look around, and then when she saw something that she wanted to 
                  photograph, to quietly take her camera, look at it, and if she saw 
                  that they objected, why, she would close it up and not take a 
                  photograph, or perhaps she would wait until… they were used to her.”</p>
                  
                  <p id="bio-text">   In 2019, Delong became the first woman awarded a Guggenheim fellowship.
              </p>

              <h3>Photography</h3>
              <p id="bio-text">   Honest, engaging, and direct, 
                Dorothy Delong is an spiring feminist artist feminist artists. 
                Since graduating from Columbia University in 2016, Dorothy has encouraged the 
                equality of men and women with a simplistic and trutheful perspective.
                Most of her work explores the humanity of women, capturing them in 
                moments where they are owning who they are in predominantly male roles.
                Looking at her photographs, installations and paintings, 
                it's no surprise that she's been lauded and described as the heir 
                apparent to Tracey Emin's throne (even as she calls this comparison 
                "lazy"). The award-winning artist lives and works in Sussex, 
                though she exhibits internationally and speaks at events around 
                the world.
